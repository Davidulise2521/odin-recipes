        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This chicken enchilada recipe is easy to make with tortillas, tender chicken, and a deliciously cheesy sauce for a family-pleasing Mexican meal.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Tortillas: I typically use store-bought corn tortillas, but you could also use flour tortillas if you prefer. If you want to make your own, here’s a recipe for homemade corn tortillas and flour tortillas.</li>
        <li>Enchilada Sauce: I highly recommend making your own enchilada sauce if you can! If you’re looking for a quick Tex-Mex version, here’s an easy enchilada sauce made from chili powder, tomato paste, and broth. And here’s my family’s authentic enchilada sauce made from whole dried chiles and Mexican chocolate. Both are easy to make and freezer-friendly, which is perfect if you want to make a big batch.</li>
        <li>Shredded Chicken: You can use any leftover shredded chicken you have in the fridge. If you don’t have any, here’s an easy recipe for shredded chicken that you can make right at home. If you don’t have time to make your own, I recommend buying a cooked rotisserie chicken from the grocery store and shredding it at home.</li>
        <li>Shredded Cheese: I typically use the pre-shredded “Mexican-style” cheese that is easily found in most grocery stores, but cheddar, mozzarella, or pepperjack also work. If you’re looking to go super authentic and use traditional Mexican cheeses, I recommend Oaxaca (quesillo), Chihuahua, or Asadero.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350ºF.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine cooked shredded chicken with 1/4 cup enchilada sauce. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Warm the tortillas in a microwave for 1 minute, flipping them halfway through until they’re warm and pliable.</li>
        <li>Assemble the enchiladas by filling each tortilla evenly with the shredded chicken mixture and a generous pinch of shredded cheese. Roll them tightly to close and place them seam-side down in a large baking dish.</li>
        <li>Bake for 20 minutes, until cheese is melted and bubbly. Serve.</li>
    </ol>
