   <h1>COCHINITA PIBIL</h1>

   <img src="../images/cochinita.jpg" alt="cochinita" height="500" width="500">
   <h2>Description</h2>
   <p>This is my favorite Mexican pork dish that is always a hit. Can be toned down with less or no peppers and still tastes awesome. If you can find Seville orange juice, use it in place of the lemon and regular orange juice for authentic Mexican flavor. Quite easy to prepare too! Your whole family will love this famous Mexican dish!</p>

   <h3>ingredients</h3>
   <ul>
     <li>2 pounds pork butt roast with bone</li>
     <li>2 tablespoons achiote paste</li>
     <li>⅓ cup orange juice</li>
     <li>⅔ cup fresh-squeezed lemon juice</li>
     <li>2 habanero peppers, seeded and chopped</li>
     <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
     <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
     <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
     <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
     <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
     <li>½ cup red wine vinegar</li>
   </ul>
   <h3>Steps</h3>
   <ol>
     <li>Poke holes all over the pork with a fork. Rub achiote paste all over the pork, and set aside. In a large bowl, mix together the orange juice, lemon juice, and habanero peppers. Mix in the cumin, paprika, chili powder, coriander, salt and pepper. Place pork in the mixture, cover, and refrigerate overnight, turning two or three times.</li>

     <li>Bake for about 2 hours, until the meat falls off the bone. The slower you cook it, the better it is. You could also bake it in a 200 degrees F (95 degrees C) oven for 4 or 5 hours, or in a slow cooker without the foil or leaves.</li>
     <li>While the pork is cooking, make the sauce. Bring the red wine vinegar to a boil in a small saucepan. Add onions, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until tender. Pour sauce over pork, and serve with white rice and corn tortillas. Each person can make tacos or fajitas with the pork, the rice and the sauce.</li>
